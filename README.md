I have putted some test properties to HomePage component
You can find HomePage component in augury on this path:
IonicApp/MyApp/Nav/TabsPage/Tabs/Tab/HomePage

as you see there is no state :/

I am expecting my properties:
myTestProperty
myTestProperty2
from /src/pages/home/home.ts

to be shown

Thanks ;)
